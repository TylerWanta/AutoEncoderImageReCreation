# AutoEncoderImageReCreation

## Goal:
Try to train an auto encoder to re create images. This was done by cutting out pieces of the images and seeing if the auto encoder could learn to fill them back in. The end goal was to be able to feed an article of clothing into the autoencoder and have it spit out full outfits that went with said article of clothing.
